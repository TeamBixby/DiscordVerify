# DiscordVerify
A PocketMine-MP Plugin that connects your Discord and Minecraft servers. The Discord bot can be found [here](https://github.com/TeamBixby/DiscordVerify-client)

# Important Note
This plugin requires a second port on your server to run.

Example: Your server runs on Port 19132. This plugin needs access to Port 19133 in order to run.
If you can not access or use more than one port on your server, this plugin **will not work**.
